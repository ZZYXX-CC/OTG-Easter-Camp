OTG Football Academy Summer Camp: A Comprehensive Training Program
The OTG Football Academy Summer Camp is a two-week non-residential program held at the
Monoliza Sports Centre from August 4th - 15th, designed to provide comprehensive development
for young athletes aged 6-18. This program focuses on football development, multi-sport exposure,
life skills workshops, and personal growth training. The camp aims to attract 175 students for a
holistic program that combines athletic training with character building and life skills development.
Main Objectives
●
●
●
●
●
Skill Development: Improve fundamental football skills such as dribbling, passing,
shooting, and tactical awareness.
Physical Conditioning: Enhance strength, endurance, agility, and flexibility through
gym workouts and swimming sessions.
Water Safety and Skills: Provide swimming instruction focusing on water safety, basic
strokes, and more advanced techniques for older age groups.
Team Building and Sportsmanship: Foster teamwork, communication, and positive
sportsmanship through small-sided games, relays, and team challenges.
Age-Appropriate Training: Tailor training activities and intensity to the specific needs
and abilities of different age groups (6-9, 10-13, 14-18).
Program
The camp will run from Monday to Friday for two weeks, with daily sessions from 8:00 AM to
1:00 PM. The training format will utilize circuit training, with students rotating through different
stations for football, swimming, and gym activities.
Facility:Mono Liza Sports Centre

●
Football Pitches: Three 5-aside pitches and one 8-aside pitch will be used for various
drills and small-sided games. Older age groups will utilize the 8-aside pitch when
possible.
Swimming Pool: A 5m x 10m pool will be used for swimming instruction, water safety,
and fun activities. Due to the pool's size, groups will be divided into smaller subgroups
for swimming sessions.
Gym: The gym will be used for strength training, conditioning, and flexibility exercises.
Gym sessions will be scheduled to allow for recovery and age-appropriate muscle
development.
Daily Schedule
Students will be divided into three age groups (6-9, 10-13, 14-18) and further divided into
subgroups for efficient rotation. A daily rotation schedule will ensure that each group
experiences all three activities (football, swimming, gym) with varying sequences. For example,
one group might start with football, then move to the gym, followed by swimming, and then back
to football, while another group follows a different order.
Activities
●
●
●
Football Training: Focus on skill development (dribbling, passing, shooting), tactical
awareness, small-sided games, and match scenarios. Age-specific drills and
modifications will be implemented to ensure appropriate challenges for each group.
Swimming Sessions: Emphasis on water safety, introduction to basic strokes, stroke
refinement, and fun water games. Older groups will work on advanced techniques and
endurance training. Due to the limited pool size, subgroups will be rotated through
shorter, more frequent swimming sessions.
Gym Workouts: Age-appropriate exercises will be conducted, with a focus on
bodyweight exercises, light weights (with supervision), plyometrics, and core
strengthening. Recovery days will be incorporated into the gym schedule to prevent
overexertion and promote muscle growth.
Logistics and Safety

Coach Allocation: Coaches will be assigned to specific activities and age groups, with a
focus on their expertise and the needs of each group.
Equipment: Necessary equipment such as cones, agility ladders,, and first-aid kits will
be available at all stations.
Hydration and Breaks: Scheduled water breaks will be implemented every 30-45
minutes to ensure proper hydration.
Safety Measures: Certified lifeguards will be present at the pool during swimming
sessions, and gym supervisors will oversee weight training for older groups.

progress.
Tournament Day: Week 2 will culminate in a camp-wide tournament with team trophies.
Parent Showcase: Invite parents on the final day for a mini-tournament and swimming
relay demo.
Feedback Session: Conduct a camp review and feedback session to gather insights for
future improvements.
Recovery:
●
●
Gym Schedule: The gym schedule will allow for rest and recovery between sessions,
especially for older groups doing strength training.
Active Recovery: We’ll incorporate active recovery sessions (light cardio, stretching,
mobility) on non-gym days.
●
Stretching: Emphasis will be on stretching after each activity to reduce muscle soreness
and improve flexibility.
